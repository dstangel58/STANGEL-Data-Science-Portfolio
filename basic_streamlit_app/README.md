## 🐧 Penguin Biology Dashboard 🐧

In this dashboard, I create a streamlit application to compare penguins in the penguins.csv dataset with both distribution and trend analysis on the basis of features like bill length and body mass. This shows trends in species across islands. Both can be toggled in the application itself. 

# 🚀 Features 🚀 
**Filtering:** Uses the st.selectbox() function for all four categorical variables for maximum flexibility.
**Key Metrics:** Performs real-time calculations of averages and other metrics, updating for species and island respectively. 

# 📊 Visualization Options 📊
**Scatter Plots:** Exploring the correlation between bill depth and length (color-coded by sex).

**Distribution Analysis:** Seaborn boxplots comparing body mass across different islands.

**Trend Analysis:** Bar charts showing average bill length per Island.

# 🏗 Operating the Dataset 🏗
Dataset: penguins.csv 
Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Streamlit
Steps to Run: 
Ensure you have the dataset: Place penguins.csv in a folder named data/.
Install Libraries: pip install 
pandas as pd 
seaborn as sns
streamlit as st
Bash, streamlit run main.py

# 📊 Visualization Key
_Quick summary of averages (Mean)_--**col#.metric** -- provides columns of summary statstics
_Scatter Plot_ -- **st.scatter_chart** -- Analyzing relationships between two continuous variables.
_Boxplot_ -- **sns.boxplot** -- Showing data distribution and outliers. (streamlit possesses not in-built version) 
_Bar Chart_ -- **st.bar_chart** -- Comparing aggregated averages across categories.
